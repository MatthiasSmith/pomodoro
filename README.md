## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animations
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static type definitions
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [useSound](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-sound) - React hook for using sounds
- React Context API - for managing application state

### What I learned

I increased my knowledge and skills with TypeScript, React, and application state during this project's development, but I'd have to say my two main takeaways from doing it are:

1. Building with accessibility in mind by adding it throughout application development is a much better approach than just adding it in at the end. Doing so helped me discover "gotchyas" with my markup and application state earlier on than if I hadn't.
2. Adding sounds to web apps is much easier than I thought it would be, and can be used to raise the user experience to a new level.

    I've always steered away from adding sound effects into web apps because of a sense that they're generally frowned upon, and also because I thought it would be more difficult to do so.
    
    However, what I found here was the opposite. 
    
    For one thing, I personally feel that sound effects add something to this experience â€” giving it that extra bit of polish and thought. Like when you set a timer and move onto another browser tab to complete some work and your timer expires. Hearing a chime to indicate that it's completed is just the sort of thing that sounds do well while not being overbearing. That being said, I wouldn't use the sounds in an office environment without headphones.
    
    Secondly, adding sounds was a straightforward process, and I was able to do so rather quickly. Finding and choosing sounds on the other hand, took way longer than I care to admit. ðŸ˜… Â
